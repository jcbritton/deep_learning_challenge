# Neural Network Model Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to develop and evaluate a neural network model for the binary classification problem of determining which factors might account for success among loan applicants. The model aimed to predict outcomes based on a set of input features including application type, classification, affiliation, use case, and organization type, with a specific goal of achieving at least 75% accuracy in its predictions.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable(s)**: 
  - The specific target variable was "IS SUCCESSFUL".

- **Feature Variables**: 
  - The features are APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS,	INCOME_AMT, and	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS.

- **Variables Removed**: 
  - Variables removed included loan ID number (EIN), name of institution applying for loan (NAME), and later, loan ammount (ASK_AMT).

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Model Architecture**:
    - Three hidden layers with a pyramid format for number of neurons per hidden layer starting at 256
    - ReLU activation for hidden layers one and two, tanh activation for the final hidden layer
    - A single output neuron with sigmoid activation

- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 0.7313 (73.13%)
  - Loss: 0.5701

- **Target Performance**:
  - The target accuracy was 75%.
  - The model fell short of this goal by approximately 1.87 percentage points.

- **Steps Taken to Improve Performance**:
  - Specific steps taken to imporove the model's accuracy include:
    - Adjusting the number of layers and neurons
    - Trying different activation functions in different layers
    - Increasing the number of epochs
    - Adjusting the batch size
    - Modifying which columns were included or excluded from the original dataset. 

## Summary

The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 73.13% on the classification task, falling short of the target accuracy of 75% by a small margin. While the model's performance is reasonably good, there's still room for improvement to meet the desired goal. The loss value of 0.5701 suggests that the model's predictions still have a significant margin of error.

### Recommendations

To potentially improve the model's performance and reach the 75% accuracy target, we could consider the following approaches:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find optimal hyperparameters for the neural network.
2. **Deeper Architecture**: Experiment with adding more layers or neurons to capture more complex patterns in the data.
3. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data and to identify any overfitting issues.

Given that the current model is close to the target accuracy, fine-tuning the existing neural network architecture or trying a different type of neural network (such as a deeper network or one with different activation functions) might be sufficient to bridge the gap. However, if these attempts don't yield the desired results, exploring alternative machine learning algorithms could be beneficial.
